# librebudget-base
Budgeting software that is free as in speech and free as in beer 

## Open source alternative to YNAB
I really like YNAB but a subscription pricing model goes against the spirit of budgeting in my mind. 
I think everyone should be able to use intuitive software to help them manage their finances, even if 
they can't afford another monthly expense. This aims to be a free replacement. 

I hope to eventually have feature-parity with YNAB4 in an easy-to-use, cross-platform package.
